# Audio-Tsukoyomi-Sound-Encryption-and-Decryption-AES-CBC-mode
A Python-based project implementing sound encryption and decryption using AES in CBC mode. Includes a user-friendly interface for selecting audio files and entering encryption/decryption keys, built for Assignment Grouping on SKJ4143 Cryptography and Application


INTERFACE
1.	Splash Screen
a.	Description: The application starts with a splash screen, a temporary window that appears when the application is launched. It usually contains branding information, an application title, and possibly an animation or an image.
b.	Functionalities:
•	Displays the application name ("AUDIO TSUKOYOMI!!!") means a symbol for powerful manipulation of a secret and excellent art.
•	Shows information about the development team ("Developed by LegionX").
•	Displays an image (Itachi's image) and a GIF (sharingan.gif) as part of the splash screen.
•	Initiates an animation (sharingan.gif frames) during the splash screen.

2.	Main Window
a.	Description: After the splash screen, the main window is displayed, which contains the primary functionalities of the application.
b.	Functionalities:
•	Includes an exit button for closing the application.
•	Displays a header with the application name and additional information about the purpose of the application.
•	Provides an interface for entering an AES key using an Entry widget.
•	Includes buttons for encrypting and decrypting audio files.
•	Utilizes labels for displaying images.

3.	Encrypt and Decrypt Audio Process
a.	Description: These processes are triggered by the input specific AES key length that must 16, 24 and 32-Byte and other respective buttons on the main window and involve encrypting and decrypting audio files using the AES algorithm.
b.	Functionalities:
•	User must input the specific key length. For example, “Thats my kung fu” that displays 16-Byte key length.
•	Opens file dialogs for selecting audio files (WAV format).
•	Handles errors during the encryption and decryption processes, displaying appropriate error messages using message boxes.
•	Saves the encrypted and decrypted audio files in temporary files.
•	Optionally provides buttons for playing and pausing the encrypted and decrypted sounds.
